# Construct WideWorldImporters OLAP Database

The scripts in this folder are used to construct the WideWorldImportersDW database from scratch on SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.

A pre-created version of the database is available for download as part of the latest release of the sample: [wide-world-importers-release](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=800630).

## Run this sample

The below steps reconstruct the WideWorldImportersDW database. To construct the full version of the sample database (for Eval/Developer/Enterprise Edition and Azure SQL DB Premium), simply follow the steps below. To construct the standard edition version (for Standard Edition and Azure SQL DB Basic/Standard), omit step 6.

<!-- Step by step instructions. Here's a few examples -->

1. Execute the script: **1-wwi-dw-metadata-population.sql** -> this script creates the WWI_DW_Preparation database that holds all required metadata to create the OLAP database.

2. Execute the script: **2-wwi-dw-construct-database-from-metadata-tables.sql** -> this script performs code generation to create the script for the OLAP database.

3. Copy the output from the execution of the previous script to a new query window and execute it. (A copy of this has been saved as 3-**wwi-dw-recreate.sql**) (If the database already existed, you will also see warnings related to it being removed and existing transactions rolled back).

4. Execute the script: **4-wwi-dw-configured-required-database-objects.sql** -> this script creates additional objects that are required that are not part of the table and schema metadata. This predominantly involves additional types, views, and stored procedures.

5. Execute the script **5-wwi-dw-load-seed-data.sql**. This script populates the seed data required for the database. It will typically take a few minutes to execute.

6. Execute the script **6-wwi-dw-enable-full-features.sql**. This script enables features for the full version of the sample database. 

  - When using SQL Server 2016 SP1 (or a later servicing release), the full features are supported across all editions of SQL Server, including Standard and Express edition.
  - With Azure SQL Database, at the time of writing, some of the full features are supported only in Premium-tier databases, so you should skip this step when targeting a Standard-tier database.

7. Execute the **WWI_Integration** SSIS package to perform the ETL to populate the database. For details see [wwi-integration-etl] (../wwi-integration-etl/).

8. Execute the script **8-wwi-dw-backup.sql**. This creates a backup of the database. Make sure to adjust the file path of the backup to match your folder structure. (A sample restore script **9-wwi-restore.sql** is also provided).

9. If required, remove the **WWI_DW_Preparation** database.
